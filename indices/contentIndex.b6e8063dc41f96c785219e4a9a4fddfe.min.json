As CEO, processing and knowledge manager, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve and automate workflows and processes.

My choice fell on Obsidian because it is more flexible due to plugins. In addition, my goal is to teach employees to maintain a Personal Knowledge Base. And only then transfer knowledge to the Corporate Knowledge Base. It is also worth noting privacy issues in Notion docs. Last but not least: KB has more value when it's not limited to directories like in Notion\n[^202211131536-3]: Zippier can be a good choice if you require simple automatization.

However, PARA is not well suited for creators (creator mode)\n\n \n\nThe Knowledge base (KB) is based on the [Zettelkasten](Zettel.md) methodology. **KB is not an encyclopedia or wiki**. Its purpose is to provide the minimum necessary information to set the right direction for further research. The character limit rule forces you to write only the most important.\n\nFollowing the [5Ws](The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md) principles provides a solid Knowledge Base structure and thus structures information → knowledge. Also, it will be easy to write and find the information knowing how the KB is arranged. Last but not least, this helps to build and support a link base in [TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com/).\n\nThe [Knowledge Base](Knowledge%20Base.md) has three levels:\n\n1. [Zettels](Zettel.md)\n1. [Content Boxes](Content%20Box.md): Zettels containers\n1. [Map of Content Box](Map%20of%20Content%20Box.md): Content Boxes outliners\n   Each of them has its own set of [tags](in_progress\\Tags.md).\n\nThis concept is easy to understand through a book analogy:\nMoCBs: table of contents\nContent Boxes: chapters\nZettels: paragraphs\n\nI am writing the CKB based on the contents of the PKB. While maintaining a PKB, I recommend adhering to a flat structure[^202208091548-1], i.e. no folders. This allows knowledge to move freely between topics and facilitates the emergence of new ideas rather than being limited to one subject.\n\n[^202208091548-1]: Don't waste time and effort thinking about structure (stick to [5Ws](The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md)) and concentrate on making connections: what knowledge does this note add? How is it related to it?\n\nCreating a KB takes a lot of effort. However, it also gives a significant output when a critical mass of notes[^202208102106-1] is collected. For PKB, this is the birth of insights[^202208102106-2]. For CPB, it is the preservation of knowledge accumulated within the company.\n\n[^202208102106-1]: In my case, I started seeing increasing output after taking notes almost daily for four months. The volume of PKB was about 500 notes with over 1 million characters\n[^202208102106-2]: Be sure to save the context in which the links between notes you made.
