Map of Content Boxes (MoCBs)[^202207311616-1] is the 3rd level of the [Knowledge Base](Knowledge%20Base.md). MoCBs are Structure Notes[^202207311616-2] and [CBs](Content%20Box.md) outliners, i.e. thematic collections of links. But may also contain whats-whys-etc in the form of [Zettel's](Zettel.md) inserts.

[^202207311616-1]: MoCB is a concept similar to the MoC of Nick Milo. Learn more on [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/). Since I [made](Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md) some changes, including focus, I decided to give a different name so as not to confuse readers
[^202207311616-2]: Structure Note or Meta-Note is a Zettel about other Zettels and their relationships. In our case, this is a note about [Content Boxes](Content%20Box.md)

MoCBs are of two types:

* a thematic list of links to CBs, i.e. act as a virtual folder
* a sequential list of links to CBs (step-by-step script/instruction) for the execution of a process for a person (role) or machine. See [Knowledge Forging Methodology](Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md)

Check the [in_progress/Raw/List of processes](in_progress\Raw\List%20of%20processes.md) for examples.
