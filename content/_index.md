Hi. Alex's here. And this is the Home page of my experiment. As CEO, processing and knowledge manager, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve and automate workflows and processes. This helps my co-workers to be more effective and reduces the time I spend tracking team progress.

To get things done, I started [The Experiment](The%20Experiment.md) that will combine my experience with the *tools*.

What do I use[^202211131536-1]:

1. Obsidian[^202211131536-2]. [Knowledge Base](Knowledge%20Base.md) creation
1. TheBrain. KB management and navigation
1. Github. Knowledge storing and publishing
1. GDrive. Synchronization with multiple devices on which I work with the KB
1. make.com[^202211131536-3]. Automation
1. Twitter. Is well-suited for sharing and enforcing the [limit rule](The%20Experiment.md)

[^202211131536-1]: Optimal selection of tools is not included in the [Goal](Goal.md). It is possible to build different sets of them, but it is the task of each organization that decides to take advantage of our results and experience. Focus on approaches and best practices, not tools.
[^202211131536-2]: You can also try [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) which is aimed at team cooperation. My choice fell on Obsidian because it is more flexible due to plugins. In addition, my goal is to teach employees to maintain a Personal Knowledge Base. And only then transfer knowledge to the Corporate Knowledge Base. It is also worth noting privacy issues in Notion docs. Last but not least: KB has more value when it's not limited to directories like in Notion
[^202211131536-3]: Zippier can be a good choice if you require simple automatization. If your organization needs maximum freedom and customization, consider [n8n.io](n8n.io). However, it requires technical skills. While make.com is something in between

Who might be interested in the experiment: business owners, C-level executives, [knowledge](in_progress\Raw\Role.%20Knowledge%20manager.md) and other managers, researchers and those who consume a lot of information and want to improve the output through [Personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)

Jumping down the rabbit hole:

1. [Terms and abbreviations](Terms%20and%20abbreviations.md)
1. [Goal](Goal.md)
1. [The Experiment](The%20Experiment.md)
1. [Knowledge Forging Methodology](Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md)
