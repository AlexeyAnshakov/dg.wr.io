The Knowledge base (KB) is based on the [Zettelkasten](..\Zettel.md) methodology. **KB is not an encyclopedia or wiki**. Its purpose is to provide the minimum necessary information to set the right direction for further research. The character limit rule forces you to write only the most important.
