## Goal

**Develop a [solid concept](..\Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md) for creating a goal-achieving corporate [Knowledge Base](..\Knowledge%20Base.md) + business process automation**

The concept should incorporate the principles of [Sociocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy), [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen), [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) and [in_progress/Raw/Ad-hoc](..\in_progress\Raw\Ad-hoc.md) into the [processes](..\in_progress\MoCB.%20Processes.md)[^202207301546-1]. 
I also want to test and measure the effectiveness of a combination of the [tools](..\in_progress\Tools.md) and [in_progress/Raw/No-code](..\in_progress\Raw\No-code.md) development ideas.

[^202207301546-1]: The experiment was also influenced by [Reinventing Organizations, Frederic Laloux](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/), [Holacracy, Bryan Robertson](https://holacracy.org), works of [Ichak Adizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichak_Adizes) and some others
