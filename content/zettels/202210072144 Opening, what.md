Knowledge Forging Methodology (KFM) is a set of principles, approaches and best practices developed to create a standard for writing [CKBs](..\Knowledge%20Base.md),  in collaboration[^202210072144-1].
It is based on an adaptation of existing approaches: [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), Ever Green[^202210072144-2] and Map of Content[^202210072144-3].
The methodology is used in the [in_progress/Raw/Dashboard](..\in_progress\Raw\Dashboard.md) project.
