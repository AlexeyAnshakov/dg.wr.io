The [Knowledge_Base](..\Knowledge_Base.md) has three levels:

1. [Zettels](..\Zettel.md)
1. [Content Boxes](..\Content_Box.md): Zettels containers
1. [in_progress/Map of Content Box](..\in_progress\Map%20of%20Content%20Box.md): Content Boxes outliners
   Each of them has its own set of [tags](..\in_progress\Tags.md).

This concept is easy to understand through a book analogy:
MoCBs: table of contents
Content Boxes: chapters
Zettels: paragraphs
