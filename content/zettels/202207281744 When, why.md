During The Experiment, I decided to keep a length note limit equal to the tweet size[^202207281744-1]:

````markdown {linenos=false}
280 characters without links
````

The character limit allows being laser-focused on one thought and keeps [Content Boxes](..\Content%20Box.md) straightforward and minimal. But enough to find all the information and links[^202207281744-2] you need to dig further[^202207281744-3].

[^202207281744-1]: If there is a reference, notes, clarifying or other information, then I take it out into footnotes. They do not fall within the limit and can often be larger than the note itself
[^202207281744-2]: Get yourself familiarized with [Progressive Summarization: A Practical Technique for Designing Discoverable Notes - Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/) to learn how to compress information effectively
[^202207281744-3]: In other words, a zettel card must contain the minimum necessary but sufficient information. Context and footnotes help to interpret it correctly
