MoCBs are of two types:

* a thematic list of links to CBs, i.e. act as a virtual folder
* a sequential list of links to CBs (step-by-step script/instruction) for the execution of a process for a person (role) or machine. See [Knowledge Forging Methodology](..\Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md)

Check the [in_progress/List of processes](..\in_progress\List%20of%20processes.md) for examples.
