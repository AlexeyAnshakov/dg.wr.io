Map of Content Boxes (MoCBs)[^202207311616-1] are the 3rd level of the [KnowledgeBase](..\KnowledgeBase.md). MoCBs are Structure Notes[^202207311616-2].

MoCBs are CBs outliners, i.e. thematic collections of links (e.g. [in_progress/List of processes](..\in_progress\List%20of%20processes.md)), but may also contain whats-whys-etc. in the form of [Zettel's](..\Zettel.md) inserts.

[^202207311616-1]: MoCB is a concept similar to the MoC of Nick Milo. Learn more on [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/). Since I [made](..\in_progress\Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md) some changes, including focus, I decided to give a different name so as not to confuse readers
[^202207311616-2]: Structure Note or Meta-Note is a Zettel about other Zettels and their relationships. In our case, this is a note about [Content Boxes](..\Content%20Box.md)
