Each block is represented by one or more [Zettels](..\Zettel.md)

I recommend adhering to the structure and section order of the [5Ws](..\The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md)[^202207291417-1]. But the effectiveness of providing information in the first place, therefore there can be multiple `what`s, `how`s sections and in any order.

[^202207291417-1]: 5Ws sections (e.g. What + Why) can and should be combined if they fit in one block
