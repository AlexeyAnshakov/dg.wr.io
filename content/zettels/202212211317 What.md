The processes of any company can be represented as a network of business pipelines, which have a starting point and an end result. A process can have one or more [inputs and outputs](..\in_progress\Input%20and%20Output.md). At the output, there must be a result:

* intermediate: an event, [launches](..\in_progress\Event.md) and is used in the next process
* final: is reflected in the progress of [KPI](..\in_progress\Raw\OKRs%20and%20KPIs.md)
