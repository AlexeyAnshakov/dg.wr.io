In [in_progress/Raw/Dashboard](..\in_progress\Raw\Dashboard.md), each process has a "Weight" parameter. It is calculated based on the sum of the weights (ranging from 1 "easy" to 10 "hard") of all tasks in child workflows. In combination with the display of the ratio of `automated / manual` tasks, the budget, output, etc. The weight parameter allows for data-driven optimization of processes.
