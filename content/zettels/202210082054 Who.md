**The main principle of the KFM** is the approach when CKB authors provide only a minimally sufficient set of related extracts that allow readers to quickly and efficiently find the information they need[^202210082054-1]. A selection of links and sources in the references (footnotes) helps to delve into the required level of understanding[^202210082054-2].

[^202210082054-1]: I.e. the task of the authors is not to throw out everything they know in the CKB, which turns the knowledge base into an impenetrable info-jungle in which it is difficult to find something: can't see the forest for the trees. Their task is to provide interconnected reference points, jumping over which the reader can easily find what he/she wants
[^202210082054-2]: The meaning of the experts during the building of the CBK is not in the creating a wiki, but provide an expert selection of the best sources and linking with other topics, in order to understand how and with what the current text is connected
