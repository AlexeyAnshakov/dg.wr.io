All processes have a *recipient* and *performer*[^1], who can be both team members and clients.
The performer, responsible for execution, is typically a team member[^2] and should be defined by [role](..\in_progress\Raw\Roles.md). In an ideal scenario, the performer does not require the participation or supervision of a manager to complete the process.

[^1]: E.g. [Process. Onboarding](..\in_progress\Raw\Process.%20Onboarding.md) → [Process. Email creation](..\in_progress\Raw\Process.%20Email%20creation.md)
[^2]: The [Dashboard](..\in_progress\Raw\Dashboard.md) service differs from other projects in that it allows participation in community processes by team members
