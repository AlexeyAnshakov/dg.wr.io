Although automation/RPA is a must-have for companies with 200+ employees, with four companies under my belt, I realized that owners should [set up](..\in_progress\Raw\Business%20Framework.md) processes asap[^202208081700-1]. And [automate](..\in_progress\Raw\Automation.md) at least trivial and everyday tasks.

[^202208081700-1]: A good analogy is to compare a company to a tree. If you initially set up processes incorrectly, your company will grow chaotically. Such a company cannot grow big. Even with favorable external factors, the company will sooner or later break under its weight of internal inefficiency
