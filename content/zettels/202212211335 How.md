Follow Business Process Improvement (BPI) practices, e.g. [Six Sigma - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma). First of all, identify and eliminate low-value steps in order to improve efficiency and productivity. That allows to focus on activities that have a greater impact on the end result. By optimizing processes in this way, it is possible to improve overall efficiency and effectiveness, leading to better business outcomes.
