There are two types of activities: [Process](..\in_progress\Process.md) [^202212041608-1] and [in_progress/Task](..\in_progress\Task.md).
When we want to model an atomic work which cannot be further broken down or makes no sense to do so, we use a Task.
Linked together Tasks are [in_progress/Job](..\in_progress\Job.md).
A Process is a set of repeatable [Workflow(s)|activities (Jobs)](..\in_progress\Workflow.md) that need to be carried out to accomplish some sort of organizational goal.

[^202212041608-1]: The [service](..\in_progress\Raw\Dashboard.md), built on the results of [The Experiment](..\The%20Experiment.md), has similarities to [BPMN](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/bpmn/what-is-bpmn/) and [Event-driven process chain - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_process_chain), but does not use sub-processes. Instead, processes can  have *parent* and *children* (stages). It is worth noting that if partners use the service, there may also be no blackboxes, i.e. processes of associates are visible. It is also possible to obtain basic customer information that allows seeing the entire chain of processes from A to Z
