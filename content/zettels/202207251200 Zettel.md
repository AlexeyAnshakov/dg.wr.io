[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) Note or [Zettel](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) is a minimal semantic unit, info-atom and the basic level of the [KnowledgeBase](..\KnowledgeBase.md). The basic rule is

````markdown {linenos=false}
one note â€“ one thought
````

Notes should be written in an academic (scientific) style: so that you can use[^202207251200-1] them in the [Content Boxes](..\Content%20Box.md) `as it is`.

[^202207251200-1]: The same Zettel can be used in several Content Boxes
