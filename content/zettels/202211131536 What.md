What do I use[^202211131536-1]:

1. Obsidian[^202211131536-2]. [Knowledge Base](..\Knowledge%20Base.md) creation
1. TheBrain. KB management and navigation
1. Github. Knowledge storing and publishing
1. GDrive. Synchronization with multiple devices on which I work with the KB
1. make.com[^202211131536-3]. Automation
1. Twitter. Is well-suited for sharing and enforcing the [limit rule](..\The%20Experiment.md)

[^202211131536-1]: Optimal selection of tools is not included in the [Goals](..\Goals.md). It is possible to build different sets of them, but it is the task of each organization that decides to take advantage of our results and experience. Focus on approaches and best practices, not tools.
[^202211131536-2]: You can also try [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) which is aimed at team cooperation. My choice fell on Obsidian because it is more flexible due to plugins. In addition, my goal is to teach employees to maintain a Personal Knowledge Base. And only then transfer knowledge to the Corporate Knowledge Base. It is also worth noting privacy issues in Notion docs. Last but not least: KB has more value when it's not limited to directories like in Notion
[^202211131536-3]: Zippier can be a good choice if you require simple automatization. If your organization needs maximum freedom and customization, consider [n8n.io](n8n.io). However, it requires technical skills. While make.com is something in between
