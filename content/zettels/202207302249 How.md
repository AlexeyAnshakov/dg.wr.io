## How

1. create a map of [WRIO](https://wr.io/) business processes[^202207302249-1] with a breakdown into scenarios to understand how to improve according to [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ): add valuable or remove detrimental
1. [in_progress/Raw/Dashboard](..\in_progress\Raw\Dashboard.md) as a single entry point
1. unification of processes for the possibility of automation
1. community feedback for further improvements

[^202207302249-1]: Sensitive processes and data will not be publicly available. However, this will not significantly impact the benefit to readers
