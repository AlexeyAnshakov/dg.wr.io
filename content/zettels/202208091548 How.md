I am writing the CKB based on the contents of the PKB. While maintaining a PKB, I recommend adhering to a flat structure[^202208091548-1], i.e. no folders. This allows knowledge to move freely between topics and facilitates the emergence of new ideas rather than being limited to one subject.

[^202208091548-1]: Don't waste time and effort thinking about structure (stick to [5Ws](..\The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md)) and concentrate on making connections: what knowledge does this note add? How is it related to it?
