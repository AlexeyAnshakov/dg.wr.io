I create [Content Boxes](..\Content%20Box.md) according to the [5Ws](..\The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md):

1. opening – introduction, description
1. what
1. why
1. who
1. when
1. where
1. how
1. closing – conclusions, links, related

`opening` and `closing` are auxiliary. I include corresponding [tag(s)](..\in_progress\Tags.md) in the Zettelkasten notes[^202207281535-1] for cataloguing.

[^202207281535-1]: I also find it valuable to add tags to the note title. It helps to track CBs structure
