When writing a thought, I recommend keeping it within 100-200 words: that's about five notes in the size of a tweet. [5Ws](..\The_5_Ws_and_1_H.md) allow you to consider a thought from the point of view of different aspects. Additional information is given in the footnote: source, references, etc.[^202207271422-1]

[^202207271422-1]: This information is not included in the tweet but is visible on the pages of the Digital Garden
