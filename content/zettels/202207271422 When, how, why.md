When writing a thought, I recommend keeping it within 100-200 words: that's about five notes in the size of a tweet. [5Ws](..\The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md) allow you to consider a thought from the point of view of different aspects. Additional information is given in the footnote: source, references, etc.[^202207271422-1]
