The process answers the questions *where*, *when*, *why*, *how and what work must be done* and *who is responsible* for doing it[^202212041633-1].

Processes follow the [Knowledge Forging Methodology](..\Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md). They can request information or modify data, i.e. generate [output](..\in_progress\Input%20and%20Output.md). Every process is linked to [a final business goal](..\in_progress\Raw\OKRs%20and%20KPIs.md).

[^202212041633-1]: Examples of business processes include receiving orders, invoicing, shipping products, updating employee information, setting a marketing budget, etc.
