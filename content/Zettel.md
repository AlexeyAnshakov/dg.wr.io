[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) Note or [Zettel](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) is a minimal semantic unit, info-atom and the basic level of the [Knowledge Base](Knowledge%20Base.md). The basic rule is

````markdown {linenos=false}
one note – one thought
````

Notes should be written in an academic (scientific) style: so that you can use[^202207251200-1] them in the [Content Boxes](Content%20Box.md) `as it is`.

[^202207251200-1]: The same Zettel can be used in several Content Boxes

During The Experiment, I decided to keep a length note limit equal to the tweet size[^202207281744-1]:

````markdown {linenos=false}
280 characters without links
````

The character limit allows being laser-focused on one thought and keeps [Content Boxes](Content%20Box.md) straightforward and minimal. But enough to find all the information and links[^202207281744-2] you need to dig further.

[^202207281744-1]: If there is a reference, notes, clarifying or other information, then I take it out into footnotes. They do not fall within the limit and can often be larger than the note itself
[^202207281744-2]: Get yourself familiarized with [Progressive Summarization: A Practical Technique for Designing Discoverable Notes - Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/) to learn how to compress information effectively

Following the [5Ws](The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md), one of the values[^202207281744-1] is written to note tags in YAML format:

````markdown {linenos=false}
[opening, who, what, when, where, why, how, closing]
````

Zettelkasten notes are compiled into MoCs and uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexeyAnshakov/dg.wr.io/blob/hugo/content/zettels/202207271428%20How.md) with the subsequent display on https://dg.wr.io/

Unlike the Ever Green approach, Zettels, in [in_progress/Knowledge Forging Methodology](in_progress\Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md), are crystallized, mature ideas that rarely change. This is a fundamental difference between PKB and CKB.

 > Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) is a collection of your and others' thoughts for further reflection and getting insights and ideas. In other words, bias toward creativity (creator mode)[^202208081715-1].
 > The goals of corporate KB (CKB) are to preserve and transfer already formed, existing knowledge (archivist mode)[^202208081715-2].

 > [^202208081715-2]: I recommend getting acquainted with [The PARA Method: A Universal System for Organizing Digital Information - Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) to those of my readers who are looking for an approach to organizing their lives and projects (archivist mode). However, PARA is not well suited for creators (creator mode)
