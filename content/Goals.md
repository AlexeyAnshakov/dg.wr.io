Many SMEs companies have a low [Bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) and conduct their processes purely in manual mode.
With each new employee, the overall efficiency decreases due to the need for constant synchronization and control.

## The Goal

**Develop a [solid concept](Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md) for creating a goal-achieving corporate [Knowledge Base](Knowledge%20Base.md) + business process automation**

The concept should incorporate the principles of [Sociocracy](in_progress\Raw\Sociocracy.%20Dynamic%20gavernance.md), [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen), [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) and [in_progress/Raw/Ad-hoc](in_progress\Raw\Ad-hoc.md) into the [processes](in_progress\MoCB.%20Processes.md)[^202207301546-1]. 
I also want to test and measure the effectiveness of a combination of the *tools* and [in_progress/Raw/No-code](in_progress\Raw\No-code.md) development ideas.

[^202207301546-1]: The experiment was also influenced by [Reinventing Organizations, Frederic Laloux](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/), [Holacracy, Bryan Robertson](https://holacracy.org), works of [Ichak Adizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichak_Adizes) and some others

### Requirements

1. employees use KB daily
1. involved in maintaining KB
1. KB output is measurable and higher than the maintenance cost
1. processes and workflows are built and [automated](in_progress\Raw\Automation.md) as much as possible: **20%** is a good starting KPI

It can be enhanced with [Robotic process automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation)

## How

1. create a map of [WRIO](https://wr.io/) business processes[^202207302249-1] with a breakdown into scenarios to understand how to improve according to [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ): add valuable or remove detrimental
1. [in_progress/Raw/Dashboard](in_progress\Raw\Dashboard.md) as a single entry point
1. unification of processes for the possibility of automation
1. community feedback for further improvements

[^202207302249-1]: Sensitive processes and data will not be publicly available. However, this will not significantly impact the benefit to readers

Iâ€™ve been using *these tools* for a while and suppose their combination can provide a synergy effect. Based on the results and experience I gained, I want to implement knowledge management into WRIO work processes.

Automation should reduce the number of errors and speed up processes rather than cut down costs.

Who might be interested in the experiment: business owners, C-level executives, [knowledge](in_progress\Raw\Role.%20Knowledge%20manager.md) and other managers, researchers and those who consume a lot of information and want to improve the output through [Personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)

Ideally, the result will be a service with a ready-made set of best practices and tools for automating the business processes of SMEs.
