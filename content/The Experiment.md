Practising [Personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), I follow the [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)[^202207292146-1] + MoC[^202207292146-2]. However, the methodology is not suitable for collaborative [KB](Knowledge%20Base.md) development. The root of the problem is that personal and corporate KBs have different goals. Therefore they should be maintained differently.

[^202207292146-1]: Check [Andy Matuschak’s notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) for details

A Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) is a collection of your and others' thoughts for further reflection and getting insights and ideas. I.e., bias toward creativity (creator mode)[^202208081715-1].
The goals of corporate KB (CKB) are to preserve and transfer already formed, existing knowledge (archivist mode)[^202208081715-2].

[^202208081715-1]: A good starting point here is [How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens: Book Summary](https://aliabdaal.com/book-notes/how-to-take-smart-notes/)
[^202208081715-2]: I recommend getting acquainted with [The PARA Method: A Universal System for Organizing Digital Information - Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) to those of my readers who are looking for an approach to organizing their lives and projects (archivist mode). However, PARA is not well suited for creators (creator mode)

Although automation/RPA is a must-have for companies with 200+ employees, with four companies under my belt, I realized that owners should [set up](in_progress\Raw\Business%20Framework.md) processes asap[^202208081700-1]. And [automate](in_progress\Raw\Automation.md) at least trivial and everyday tasks.

[^202208081700-1]: A good analogy is to compare a company to a tree. If you initially set up processes incorrectly, your company will grow chaotically. Such a company cannot grow big. Even with favorable external factors, the company will sooner or later break under its weight of internal inefficiency

Therefore, I decided to create a [in_progress/Raw/Business Framework](in_progress\Raw\Business%20Framework.md) based on the [Knowledge Forging Methodology](Knowledge%20Forging%20Methodology.md) that:

1. would be sound for developing corporate KBs
1. by design is suitable for creating instructions and recipes for automation
1. the value for SMEs must be higher than the cost of implementation

A best practice is to train and instil the habit of PKM in as many employees as possible. This allows the philosophy of knowledge to permeate the entire structure of the company, to become part of its DNA. And will simplify the practice of maintaining a corporate KB.

Adhering to PKM practices solves the problem that KBs remain unclaimed in many companies. In addition, you have to include the use of KB in daily work. And for this, KB must be hardcoded into [in_progress/MoCB. Processes](in_progress\MoCB.%20Processes.md).
