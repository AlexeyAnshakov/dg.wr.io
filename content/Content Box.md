Content Boxes (CBs) are the 2nd level of the [Knowledge Base](Knowledge%20Base.md) and contain [Zettels](Zettel.md). I recommend keeping CBs completely blank, without even headers, and inserting Zettelkasten notes only.

I create [Content Boxes](Content%20Box.md) according to the [5Ws](The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md):

1. opening – introduction, description
1. what
1. why
1. who
1. when
1. where
1. how
1. closing – conclusions, links, related

`opening` and `closing` are auxiliary. I include corresponding [tag(s)](in_progress\Tags.md) in the Zettelkasten notes[^202207281535-1] for cataloguing.

[^202207281535-1]: I also find it valuable to add tags to the note title. It helps to track CBs structure

Each block is represented by one or more [Zettels](Zettel.md).

I recommend adhering to the structure and section order of the [5Ws](The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md)[^202207291417-1]. But the effectiveness of providing information in the first place, therefore there can be multiple `what`s, `how`s sections and in any order.

[^202207291417-1]: 5Ws sections (e.g. What + Why) can and should be combined if they fit in one block

When writing a thought, I advise keeping it within 100-200 words: that's about five notes in the size of a tweet. [5Ws](The%205%20Ws%20and%201%20H.md) allow you to consider a thought from the point of view of different aspects. Additional information is given in the footnote: source, references, etc.[^202207271422-1]

[^202207271422-1]: This information is not included in the tweet but is visible on the pages of the Digital Garden
