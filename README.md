Hi. Alex's here. And this is the Home page of my experiment. As CEO, processing and knowledge manager, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve and automate workflows and processes. This helps my co-workers to be more effective and reduces the time I spend tracking team progress.

To get things done, I started The Experiment which will combine my experience with the tools:

1. Obsidian. Knowledge base creation
1. TheBrain. Knowledge base management and navigation
1. Github. Knowledge storing and publishing
1. Google Drive. Synchronization with multiple devices on which I work with the Knowledge Base
1. make.com or n8n.io. Automation
1. Twitter. According to Zettel's character limit rule, Twitter is well-suited for sharing with the public

Who might be interested in the experiment: business owners, C-level executives, [knowledge](in_progress\Raw\Role.%20Knowledge%20manager.md) and other managers, researchers and those who consume a lot of information and want to improve the output through [Personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)

Jumping down the rabbit hole:
